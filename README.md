# Superstore Sales Analysis and Prediction üõíüìà

## Overview

The **Superstore Sales Analysis and Prediction** project aims to analyze sales data from a fictional superstore and build predictive models to forecast future sales. This project utilizes Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, along with machine learning models from Scikit-learn.

## Project Description

This project involves:
- Exploring and cleaning the dataset to ensure data quality.
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights.
- Visualizing sales trends, including seasonal patterns and product performance.
- Building predictive models to forecast future sales based on historical data.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


 ## Data Source üìä
  The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from the Superstore dataset, which contains information about sales transactions, customer demographics, and product details.
  
  ## Data Analysis üîç
  ### Data Cleaning: The dataset was cleaned to handle missing values and incorrect data types.
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Key metrics were analyzed, including total sales, profit, and quantity sold by category, region, and shipping mode.

  # Model Building üèóÔ∏è
  Multiple predictive models were built to forecast future sales, including:
  
  ## Linear Regression: A baseline model to understand relationships between features and sales.
  Decision Tree Regressor: To capture non-linear relationships in the data.
  Random Forest Regressor: To improve prediction accuracy by averaging multiple decision trees.
  Model Evaluation
  Each model's performance was evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R¬≤).
  
  Results üèÜ
  The best-performing model achieved an R¬≤ score of [insert your best score] on the validation set, indicating a strong ability to predict sales based on historical data.
